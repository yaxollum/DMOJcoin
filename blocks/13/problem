A robot has stolen treasure from a factory and needs to escape without getting caught. The factory can be modelled by an N by M grid, where the robot can move up, down, left, or right.

Each cell of the grid is either empty, a wall, a camera, a conveyor, or the robotâ€™s initial position. The robot can only walk on empty cells (denoted by .) or conveyors. The first row, last row, first column and last column of the grid consists of walls (denoted by W), and there may be walls in other cells.

Conveyors cause the robot to move in a specific direction, denoted by L, R, U, D for left, right, up, down respectively. The robot is unable to move on its own while on a conveyor. It is possible that the robot can become stuck forever on conveyors.

Cameras (denoted by C) can see in all four directions up, down, left, and right, but cannot see through walls. The robot will be caught if it is in the same cell as a camera or is seen by a camera while not on a conveyor. Conveyors are slightly elevated, so the robot cannot be caught while on a conveyor, but cameras can see empty cells on the other side of conveyors.

The robot is initially at the cell denoted by S. The exit could be at any of the empty cells. For each empty cell, determine the minimum number of steps needed for the robot to move there without being caught, or determine that it is impossible to move there. A step consists of moving once up, down, left or right. Being moved by a conveyor does not count as a step.
