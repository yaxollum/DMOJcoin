Numerous local and international recreational runners were eager to take part in this year's Zagreb Marathon! It is an already traditional race 42125 meters long. A curious statistical info is that this year every single contestant managed to complete the race, except one.

Since marathons are all about taking part, help the organizers figure out, based on the list of registered contestants and ranking list, the identity of the contestant that did not complete the race.
