Tudor is sitting in math class, on his laptop. Clearly, he is not paying attention in this situation. However, he gets called on by his math teacher to do some problems. Since his math teacher did not expect much from Tudor, he only needs to do some simple addition problems. However, simple for you and I may not be simple for Tudor, so please help him!
