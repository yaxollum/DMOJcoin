Jo is a blogger, specializing in the critique of restaurants. Today, she wants to visit all the Vietnamese Pho restaurants in the Waterloo area, in order to determine which one is the best.

There are N restaurants in the city of Waterloo, numbered 0 to N−1. However, only M of them are Pho restaurants. Jo can choose to start at any restaurant. There are N−1 roads in Waterloo, each road connecting exactly two restaurants. It is possible to reach every restaurant from any restaurant using these roads. It takes Jo exactly 1 minute to travel along any road.

One property that is true for all trees is that there is exactly one path that does not repeat any roads between any two points in the tree.

What is the minimal length of time that Jo needs to spend on traveling on roads to visit all of the Pho restaurants?
