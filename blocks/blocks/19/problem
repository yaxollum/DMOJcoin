The Logging Company has a long line of N (1 \le N \le 1\,000\,000) trees numbered from 0 to N-1. Each tree i has a mass m_i (0 \le m_i \le 2000). The Company wants to cut some of the trees, so they hired you to calculate the mass of all the wood they would get from cutting all the trees between positions a and b inclusive (0 \le a, b < N). In particular, they want you to answer Q (1 \le Q \le 1\,000\,000) such queries.
