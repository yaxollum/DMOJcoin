Pinball is an arcade game in which an individual player controls a silver ball by means of flippers, with the objective of accumulating as many points as possible. At the end of each game, the player's score and rank are displayed. The score, an integer between 0 and 1000000000, is that achieved by the player in the game just ended. The rank is displayed as "r of n". n is the total number of games ever played on the machine, and r is the position of the score for the just-ended game within this set.

More precisely, r is one greater than the number of games whose score exceeds that of the game just ended.
